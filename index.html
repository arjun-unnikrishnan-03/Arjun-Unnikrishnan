    <p class="text-center">👤 About Me
Hello! I’m Arjun U, a passionate and evolving software engineer and AI enthusiast on a mission to create impactful digital solutions while growing into the best version of myself—technically, professionally, and personally.

🚀 My Journey So Far
From completing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) to diving deep into the real-world tech industry, my journey has been a blend of structured learning, practical experiences, and relentless curiosity. I've explored multiple technologies, built intelligent systems like age and gender detection models, and continuously expanded my skill set across software development, AI/ML, and web technologies.

I am currently undergoing an intense .NET full-stack developer training program, covering advanced modules like ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API, Entity Framework, Angular, DevOps (Jenkins), and Microservices, along with daily challenges, capstone projects, and industry-oriented grooming. My focus is not just to learn—but to master.

🧠 Technical Arsenal
I specialize in building clean, efficient, and scalable software solutions. My current tech stack and areas of focus include:

Languages: C#, Python, Java (basic)

Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Angular

Frameworks & Platforms: ASP.NET Core, MVC, Entity Framework, ADO.NET

Databases: SQL Server, MySQL

Data Analytics & AI/ML: Python, Pandas, NumPy, TextBlob, Scikit-learn

Version Control & DevOps: Git, GitHub, Jenkins (CI/CD)

Tools: Visual Studio, VS Code, Postman, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

Special Projects: Age & gender prediction using computer vision, astrology-focused LLM-based chatbot, and portfolio site with animations and interactive elements.

Currently, I’m also diving into data cleaning, NLP preprocessing techniques (like stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging), and sharpening my problem-solving using platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and assignments involving 45+ MCQs and coding problems daily.

🌍 Career Vision
My ultimate dream is to work at Google, aiming for roles like ST-1 or ST-2, not just for the brand but for the culture, the impact, and the challenges it brings. I see myself contributing to cutting-edge technologies—AI, intelligent systems, backend architectures, and robust, scalable applications.

I aim to reach a 30 LPA salary by 2027, backed by real skills, leadership, and domain expertise.

💡 Personal Values & Traits
Growth-Minded: I actively work on improving communication, breaking bad habits, and building discipline through consistency.

Self-Aware: I’ve faced challenges—like being a night owl, facing job loss, and family burdens—but I’ve always chosen to rise, reflect, and restart.

Curious by Nature: Whether it’s learning about the stock market, mastering German to explore Germany, or studying for GATE with IIT Madras as a goal, I pursue knowledge with a long-term mindset.

Resilient & Responsible: Life has tested me—but each struggle has made me sharper, more empathetic, and more determined.

🌱 Beyond Code
I love reading self-development books, especially Atomic Habits, which has changed how I build habits and approach life.

I enjoy nature, sunsets, and music, finding healing and perspective in their presence.

I am also working on personal transformation, breaking out of addictions and mental fatigue, and striving to build discipline, mental clarity, and purpose.

I deeply believe in the power of consistency, mindfulness, and community—and I want my life and career to reflect those values.

🔗 Let’s Connect
If you’re reading this, know that I’m not just another developer—I’m someone who’s willing to learn, unlearn, and rebuild with humility, energy, and ambition. Whether you're a mentor, recruiter, collaborator, or fellow learner—I'd love to connect and grow together.</p>

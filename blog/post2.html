    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      Just a year ago, I barely knew what AI really meant. It sounded intimidating and complicated — something only PhDs or data scientists could understand. But deep inside, I was always curious: <em>Can I build machines that think?</em>
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      My journey began with a simple YouTube video on machine learning. It introduced concepts like training data and predictions. That night, I installed Python and ran my first "Hello World" using Jupyter Notebook. I had no idea what NumPy or Pandas were, but I was hooked.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      Over the next few weeks, I challenged myself to learn one small concept each day: cleaning datasets, building simple models using <strong>scikit-learn</strong>, and eventually diving into <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. I failed — a lot. Models didn’t converge, code threw weird errors, and my laptop would hang during training. But each failure made me stronger.

      “The most powerful thing I learned wasn’t AI itself — it was patience.”
    </blockquote>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      After three months, I built an <strong>Age and Gender Detection</strong> app using OpenCV and deep learning models. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked. Seeing that project come to life made every sleepless night worth it.

      I documented it all here:

      Today, I’m continuing to grow — learning about NLP, transformers, and deploying AI apps. This blog is a small reflection of my path, and I hope it inspires others to start theirs.
